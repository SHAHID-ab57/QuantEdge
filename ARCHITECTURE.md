### Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript dashboard in
`apps/dashboard`, styled with a dark-only Material UI v7 theme and backed by
TanStack Query (server state) and Zustand (local UI state). See
[`FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md) for the full breakdown of routes, the
feature-module pattern, the API client, and the reusable candlestick chart
module (`src/components/chart/`) that renders historical OHLCV data with
TradingView's lightweight-charts. It talks to `services/api` exclusively
over the read-only REST surface described in [`docs/api/API.md`](docs/api/API.md);
there is no server-to-browser push channel yet.
